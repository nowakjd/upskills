## About the components
This app is developed with [Java](https://www.java.com/), uses [Spring](https://spring.io/) framework, for database engine we decided to use [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) version 14.1.

## Developing locally

If you would like to develop locally we recommend using docker, it is used for starting database server.

### Setup

You need  [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and  docker-compose which is a part of Docker desktop.
Clone this repo and start the database server configuration
We do this with docker-compose, run `docker-compose up` then you can access database from `http://localhost:8090`.
Also, database credentials are needed, report to our team for the appropriate database data.


### Deploying the app

To deploy to **upskills.sii.pl** you need to wait - we will add app server soon.
